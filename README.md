# Anime Quiz

Minimalist anime guessing game with powerup system.

## Setup

1. Add your anime image to `images/image1.jpg`
2. Edit `script.js` and change the `correctAnswer` variable to your anime name
3. Open `index.html`

## How It Works

- Start with 2000 points
- Image starts zoomed in (3x)
- Two powerups available:
  - **first letters** (-1000 points): Shows first letter of each word
  - **zoom out** (-500 points): Zooms out to full view
- Using both powerups = 500 points remaining
- Guess correctly to win with remaining points

## Daily Update

1. Replace `images/image1.jpg` with new image
2. Update `correctAnswer` in `script.js`
3. Done
